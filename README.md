# Sieve of Eratosthenes

This repo includes implementations of [Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) in some programming languages. Firstly I added initial implementations in `C`, `C++`, `C#`, `JavaScript`, `PHP`, `Python` and `Ruby`.

## How to use
I recommend using Visual Studio to compile `C++`, `C#` codes. If you don't change this, please add following line to only `.cpp` file:
> `#include "stdafx.h"`

To compile `.c` file you can use any C compiler, or either refer [this](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb384838(v=vs.110).aspx).

To use `.js` file just include it in your `.html` file & open your console. :smirk:

## Participating
If you want to add new implementation in other language(s) and/or found bugs and/or if you want to improve existing codes, please don't hesitate and make pull request. :innocent: :blush:


Good luck. :sunglasses: :smile:
